# image-encrypter

Just a lil toy project to learn about implementing ChaCha and to try my idea of in-place encrypted images (images that are encrypted but still valid images), I'd say it was fairly successful!

DO NOT USE THIS FOR ACTUALLY SECURITY/ENCRYPTION PURPOSES. MY CODE IS PROBABLY BAD AND INSECURE! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

Usage: [encrypt || decrypt] [photo file] [key]
